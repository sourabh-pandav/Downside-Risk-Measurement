# Downside-Risk-Measurement
Overview
Financial risk analysis and management are crucial aspects of investment strategies. This Python project delves into the theoretical foundation and practical implementation of risk management techniques using historical stock data. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of downside risk measurement, Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), and advanced risk management methodologies.

Theoretical Concepts
1. Downside Risk Measurement:
Definition: Downside risk refers to the potential for losses in an investment portfolio. It focuses on adverse outcomes rather than overall volatility.

Application: The project analyzes downside risk through drawdown, which measures the decline in portfolio value from its peak.

2. Value at Risk (VaR):
Definition: VaR quantifies the maximum potential loss at a given confidence level over a specified time horizon.

Calculation: The code calculates VaR at different confidence levels (90%, 95%, 99%) based on the historical percentage change in stock prices.

3. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR):
Definition: CVaR, also known as Expected Shortfall, measures the expected loss beyond VaR, given that the loss exceeds VaR.

Calculation: The project computes CVaR at the same confidence levels as VaR, providing a deeper insight into the potential extent of losses.

4. Additional Details and Best Practices:
Explanation: The project includes an explanation of VaR and CVaR to enhance understanding.

Insights: It offers insights into the interpretation and significance of calculated risk measures.

5. Visualizations:
Drawdown Plot: Visualizes the wealth drawdown over time, providing a graphical representation of portfolio performance.

Distribution Visualization: Plots the distribution of daily percentage changes and fits a normal distribution, aiding in the comprehension of risk.

6. Advanced Risk Management Techniques:
Stress Testing: A technique to evaluate portfolio performance under extreme scenarios, implemented through stress_test function.

Scenario Analysis: Examining the impact of hypothetical scenarios on portfolio returns, implemented through scenario_analysis function.

Dynamic Hedging: Utilizing a simple moving average to dynamically hedge portfolio returns against volatility.

Factor Risk Management: Employs ARCH/GARCH models to forecast volatility and manage risk efficiently.

Conclusion
This project goes beyond code execution, aiming to equip users with a deep understanding of financial risk concepts. By exploring theoretical foundations and practical implementations, users can make informed decisions in risk management and navigate the complexities of investment strategies.
